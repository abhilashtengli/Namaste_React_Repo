Q.1 | What is Emmet?
sol:  Emmet is a tool for web developers to write HTML and CSS code faster using shortcuts. It turns quick commands into complex code, making coding quicker.
      Think of it as a coding helper that speeds up creating web pages.

Q.2 | Difference between a Library and Framework? in short
sol:  A library provides tools for specific tasks that developers can choose to use, while a framework offers a complete structure with rules and tools that
      developers must follow. Libraries are like tools you can pick and choose from, and frameworks are like pre-built blueprints you have to work within.

Q.3 | What is CDN? Why do we use it?
sol:  A CDN is a network of servers spread worldwide that stores website content. When you want to access a site, it delivers the content from the nearest server, 
      speeding up loading times.
     
      Use -> We use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to make websites and online content load faster for users. CDNs store copies of website files in multiple 
      locations around the world, bringing the content closer to users. This reduces the time it takes for content to travel from the main server to the user's device, 
      improving loading speed and overall performance

Q.4 | Why is React known as React?
sol:  It is called "React" because of its core concept of reacting to changes in data. It's designed to efficiently update and render components when there are changes 
      in the underlying data or state.

Q.5 | What is crossorigin in script tag?
sol:  When crossorigin is set to "anonymous," it allows content from different websites to be used without giving away any personal info. If set to "use-credentials," 
      it means the computer checks if you're allowed to access the content based on your credentials, like a password.

Q.6 | What is diference between React and ReactDOM
sol:  React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides the tools and structure to create reusable UI components, manage state,
      and handle updates efficiently. React focuses on the logic and structure of your user interface.

      ReactDOM: ReactDOM is a package specifically designed to work with React and is responsible for rendering React components into the DOM (Document Object Model),
      which is the way browsers represent and manipulate web page content. It's the glue that connects React components to the actual HTML elements on a webpage.

Q.7 | What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
sol:  react.development.js: This version of the React library is meant for development purposes. It includes extra warnings, error messages, and debugging tools 
      that help developers identify and fix issues while building and testing their applications. It's larger in size compared to the production version because 
      it prioritizes providing detailed feedback for developers during the development process.

      react.production.js: This version of the React library is optimized for production-ready applications. It has all the same features as the development version but
      with the warnings, error messages, and debugging tools removed. This makes the file smaller and faster to load, which is important for delivering a smooth and 
      efficient user experience on production websites.

      When you're building and testing your application, you'd typically use the react.development.js version to take advantage of the additional debugging features. 
      When deploying your  application to a live website, you'd switch to the react.production.js version to ensure better performance and reduced file size for your users.

Q.8 | What is async and defer? 
sol:  async and defer are attributes that can be used when including external JavaScript files using the <script> tag in HTML. They affect how the browser loads and executes
      the script while the rest of the HTML page is being processed.
  
      Async:
        When you add the async attribute to the <script> tag, it tells the browser to continue loading the HTML content without waiting for the script to finish downloading or 
        executing.As soon as the script is downloaded, it's executed immediately, even if the HTML parsing is not yet complete. This can potentially lead to scripts 
        being executed out of order, especially if multiple async scripts are present.
 
      Defer:
        When you add the defer attribute to the <script> tag, it also allows the HTML content to load without interruption.
        However, unlike async, deferred scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML document, just before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. This ensures 
        that scripts are executed in a more predictable order, which can be important for maintaining the correct functionality of the web page.
